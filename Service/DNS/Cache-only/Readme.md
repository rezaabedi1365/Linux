To install and configure a caching-only DNS server on Ubuntu, you can use BIND9, which is a popular DNS server software. A caching-only DNS server does not host any zones but caches DNS query results to speed up subsequent requests.

## Steps to Install and Configure a Caching-Only DNS Server on Ubuntu

**1. Update the System**

Start by updating your package lists and upgrading installed packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**2. Install BIND9**

Install BIND9 and its utilities:

```bash
sudo apt install bind9 bind9utils -y
```

**3. Configure BIND9 for Caching**

Edit the main BIND options configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.options
```

Modify or add the following configuration inside the `options` block:

```bash
options {
    directory "/var/cache/bind";

    dnssec-validation auto;

    // Allow queries from localhost and your local network (adjust subnet as needed)
    allow-query { localhost; 192.168.1.0/24; };

    recursion yes;

    listen-on { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.15; };  // Replace with your server IP or use 'any;' to listen on all interfaces

    listen-on-v6 { none; };  // Disable IPv6 listening if not needed
};
```

- `recursion yes;` enables the server to perform recursive queries (necessary for caching).
- `allow-query` restricts who can query your DNS server.
- `listen-on` defines which IP addresses the DNS server listens on.

Save and close the file.

**4. Restrict BIND to IPv4 (optional)**

Edit the default options to force BIND to use IPv4:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/named
```

Add or modify the line:

```bash
OPTIONS="-u bind -4"
```

Save and exit.

**5. Restart BIND Service**

Apply the changes by restarting the DNS service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bind9
```

**6. Verify DNS Server is Running**

Check if BIND is listening on the expected ports:

```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep named
```

You can also test DNS resolution locally:

```bash
dig @127.0.0.1 google.com
```

If you get a valid response, your caching DNS server is working correctly.

This setup creates a caching-only DNS server with BIND9 on Ubuntu, which will cache DNS queries to improve resolution times for clients on your network. It does not serve any DNS zones itself.

This method is based on the detailed guides for setting up caching DNS servers on Ubuntu using BIND9[5][6][8][9].
